A simple Python launcher
========================

This is a very simple launcher for Python scripts.

A copy of the launcher named ```foo.exe``` will launch a Python
program named ```foo.pyz```, ```foo.py``` or ```foo.zip``` which
is stored alongside the executable.

You can save a number of launchers with their associated scripts
in a directory which also contains a copy of the "embedded" Python
distribution and you will have a standalone distribution of your
scripts.

CAVEATS
-------

* This isn't very well tested yet. There *will* be bugs.
* Your script will see the launcher as ```sys.executable```. This is
  correct, but may confuse programs or libraries that assume that
  ```sys.executable``` is the Python interpreter.
